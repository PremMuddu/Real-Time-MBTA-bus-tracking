# Real-Time-MBTA-bus-tracking: 

Tracking live bus movement by integrating two API's. 

Integrated MBTA API with mapbox API to track the bus movement in real time based on the longitude and latitude.  

Future Improvements for this project would be to add in a zoom factor that takes directly to the live streets of the route and may be a bus icon instead of a default marker.
